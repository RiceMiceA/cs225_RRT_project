## Project Summary

Our proposed final project is to implement the 'black box' method for searching a large text file for specific patterns.

## Code

All code files can be found in the `code/` directory. To run the code:

1. Create a `build` directory inside `code/`

2. CD into `build` and run `cmake ..` and `make`.

3. Modify the `main.cpp` file to run whichever `.csv` parsed file you want to time.

## Data

The test data contains RNA sequencing studies of mice with sizes ranging from 100 subsampled kmers to 10000 kmers.

## Documents

The proposal can be found in the `documents/` directory.

## Feedback

All feedback from our project mentor can be found in the `feedback/` directory.
